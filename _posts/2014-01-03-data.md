## Primary dataset - Quotebank

- quotebank collects worldwide quotes from media outlets and identifies the speakers including their link to Wikidata



## Choice of subset

### Clean dataset:

- restrict ourselves to quotes containing infromatino about gender above a CERTAIN probability threshold so can be assigned to women/men/other

- can show our initial analysis here about proportion

- further cleaning

## Enhanced dataset by other sources 

- Extraction of gender from wikidata
- 
- Extraction of provenance of media outlets and their political biasby scraping information from https://mediabiasfactcheck.com, an online resource created to help navigate the bias in the flood of new online media emerging every day by classifying their country of origin, their rank in factual reporting and their political bias

### Subset:

- We focus on studying female representation in the cultural realm of the USA thus only selecting media from the US or focusing on the US

- While for the descriptive analyses we look at all media outlets from the USA, for the topic analyses we restrict ourselves further by investigating the **top 10** most frequented media
  - Webscraping to get frequency estimates
    - within frequencies use number of quotes as additional estimate to rank - aware that not perfect
